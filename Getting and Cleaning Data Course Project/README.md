* Step 1: Make sure the data folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' containing all the data is in your working directory. If it is not you can either: copy it there, change your working directory with setwd() or change the scrpit to contain the correct filepath.
* Step 2: run the run_analysis.R file. This will write a file called "tidy_data.txt". It will also generate a codebook called 'codebook.md'
